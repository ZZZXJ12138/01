<p>The purpose of this systematic review was to critically analyse the available evidence
about the validity and reliability of field-based tests used for fitness in soccer referees. In
accordance with the obtained results, it seems that aerobic endurance can be accurately
assessed by means of these tests, while there is a lack of information regarding the
psychometric properties of anaerobic endurance and short distance sprint tests. In addition,
no field-based tests for assessing decision-making skills were found. These findings
can help major international and national institutions make better decisions about the
degree to which their affiliated referees are prepared to lead matches and improve
refereeing programmes to rotate those who retire due to their age (Weston et al., 2012).</p>
<p>The first finding of interest is that the majority of studies found focused on evaluating
the psychometric properties of tests that measured the aerobic endurance, speed and
COD of the referees. No study analysed the validity and reliability of physical-cognitive
tests in which correct decisions must be made under a high level of fatigue. This is a very
notable deficiency in the current evidence, given that the referees usually reach their best
refereeing level at an average age of over 35 years, from which the fitness status
decreases. Conversely, from that age on, their decision-making quality rises, allowing
them to save on physical effort without jeopardizing their performance during the match
(Castillo, Cámara, et al., 2016). Hence, there is a need for valid and reliable tests for referees
that involve decision-making under high fatigue conditions. In this way, both cognitive
and physical fitness of the referee are demanded simultaneously and may compensate
each other depending on the referee’s age, as it similarly occurs in elite soccer players
(Guerra et al., 2019).</p>
<p>Regarding anaerobic endurance tests, only two (ARIET and 12MRT) were subjected to
criterion validity, with good results. Both also obtained good results regarding absolute
reliability. Therefore, both seem advisable to assess this ability. Nonetheless, the 12MRT is
a continuous test, so it does not adequately re&amp;ect the intermittent profile of a match
(Krustrup &amp; Bangsbo, 2001). In fact, in 2005, FIFA removed this test from its test battery to
replace it with an intermittent one (FIFA, 2016). Therefore, the only test that can be recommended
based on the results obtained is the ARIET. However, more research is required in this
regard since only one study evaluated the psychometric properties of this test.</p>
<p>Although aerobic endurance is widely recognized as essential for soccer referees to be
successful, the ability to perform high intensity and anaerobic activities interspersed with
less intense and aerobic efforts, represents a decisive factor in order to keep up with the
matches (Weston et al., 2012). Consequently, anaerobic endurance tests with sufficient
validity and reliability are required. In this review, three tests for assessing this fitness
dimension were found, and all of them were based on the performance of repeated
sprints. These kinds of tests were introduced in the FIFA test battery in 2016, and they
have shown high convergent and construct validity values. Besides, these tests seem to be
accurate, as they best fit, the real physical fitness demands of the referees. Nevertheless, it
should be noted that further research is needed to determine their reliability and criterion
validity before establishing a solid recommendation on their use.</p>
<p>Speed is a necessary capacity for refereeing in elite soccer since the referee performs
between 21 and 30 sprints per match to locate and evaluate the play correctly (Casajús &amp;
Castagna, 2007; Weston et al., 2012), which makes it necessary to have speed tests with
high psychometric properties. The evaluated tests used different distances (between 5
and 200 metres), so there are important differences regarding the evaluated speed phase
(Castillo, Cámara et al., 2016). Only the 50-m sprint test and the 20-m sprint test evaluated
reliability, reporting high absolute reliability values. No test was subjected to criterion
validity, while, in general, the tests reported adequate levels of construct or convergent
validity. Taking these results into account, and knowing that in 90% of the cases, the
players perform sprints of less than 5 seconds and less than 30 metres (Castillo, Cámara
et al., 2016), it is probable that the shorter distance tests have a greater content validity.
Based on this assumption and considering the psychometric properties of the sprint tests
analysed in this review, it could be thought that the 50-m sprint test may be the most
suitable for evaluating speed in soccer referees mainly for two reasons. Firstly, although
50 metres is a longer distance than that usually covered by players during a match, it is
still one of the shortest distances analysed within the studies included in this review.
Secondly, the 50-m test was the only speed test, alongside the 200-m test, that showed
absolute reliability, as well as high convergent and construct validity values. However, the
utility of the 50-m test has been called into question, since it has been suggested that it
appears to be a poor predictor of referees’ physical performance during competitive
matches (Mallo et al., 2007). Thus, further studies are needed to confirm the reliability
and validity of shorter distance speed tests.</p>
<p>In today’s football, referees change their driving pattern every 5–6 seconds
(Krustrup &amp; Bangsbo, 2001), so it is important to have valid and reliable tests measuring
COD. Only the 10-8-8-10 test and the MAT were subjected to analysis, reporting
high values in absolute and relative terms. Moreover, these two tests showed the
ability to discriminate according to the referee level and/or the age of the referee.
Criterion validity was not evaluated in any case. It should be noted that all the tests
evaluated the physical component of agility (i.e., COD ability defined as a movement
where no immediate reaction to a stimulus is required and is considered pre-planned
in nature). This is an aspect to take into account since, in open motor contexts, it has
been identified that, while the physical component of agility allows to overcome
situations in which the movement pattern can be predefined (Sisic et al., 2016), the
cognitive component of agility determines changes in direction when the individual
has to react to an external stimulus (Scanlan et al., 2015; Trecroci et al., 2019).
Therefore, the tests that evaluate the physical component of agility could be more
suitable for the ARs, with the MAT being the most recommended due to its levels of
absolute and relative reliability and convergence and construct validity. More research
on testing the cognitive components of agility is needed to have valid evidence and
reliability for the FRs.</p>
<p>The main strength of this work is the fact that, according to the authors’ knowledge,
this is the first review focused on the analysis of the psychometric properties of tests
designed for soccer referees. Therefore, the conclusions of this work can be very useful for
professionals who evaluate the fitness of referees, as well as for coaches dedicated to their
physical preparation.</p>
<p>There are some inherent limitations that should be taken into account. Firstly, most
studies did not report on the criterion validity, and since this is the only objective measure
of validity, the results obtained should be interpreted considering this aspect (Currell &amp;
Jeukendrup, 2008). Moreover, the studies analysed were carried out mainly with professional
referees from European leagues. Refereeing at a higher competitive level raises the
kinematic demands of the referees to keep up with the match. In this sense, the teams’
playing style and level are in&amp;uenced by each country’s specific context. Thus, depending
on the league that the referee officiates in, the physical and physiological demands differ
(Barbero-Álvarez et al., 2012). Therefore, it is likely that the results obtained cannot be
extrapolated to non-European and/or lower-level leagues. Furthermore, research on ARs
is sparse. This limits any generalization given that their physiological demands are
different with respect to the FR (i.e., less total distance and high intensity running, less
decisional challenges, more demand for physical factors vs cognitive factors of agility)
(Mallo et al., 2009; Weston et al., 2012). Therefore, more research is needed on those tests
that measure fitness levels according to the physical demands of the ARs. In addition, no
study evaluated the tests on a female sample, and the results obtained cannot be applied
to the female sex due to the important physiological differences between the sexes that
in&amp;uence sports performance and the different reference values for women in physical
fitness field-based tests (Hunter, 2016; Lundsgaard &amp; Kiens, 2014; Schmitz et al., 2018).
Finally, the main methodological limitation of this review is the potential risk that the
reviewed evidence is not complete due to language restrictions or the fact that we did not
include grey literature in the search.</p>
