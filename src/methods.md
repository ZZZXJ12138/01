# 研究对象与研究方法

## 研究设计与流程

本研究通过系统性的回顾，来分析或提供有关足球裁判员场地体能测试的可靠性和/或效度的信息。

## 样本收集

在 2020 年 2 月 至 2020 年 5 月期间，研究人员在 PubMed 数据库中对经同行评审的研究进行实证搜索，研究无时间限制。

首先，使用以下关键词进行检索：

> [“Football” OR “Soccer”] AND [“Reliability”] AND [“Validity”] AND [“Test” OR “Fitness test”] 

备选研究必须满足以下标准：
1. 描述至少一项由裁判员执行的场地体能测试的可靠性和/或效度；
2. 发表在经同行评审的 SCI 科学期刊中。

对属于以下类别的研究予以排除：
1. 论文摘要或全文存在访问限制；
2. 研究其它足球范式（美式足球、澳式足球、室内足球）；
3. 使用西班牙语、葡萄牙语和英语以外的语言。


## 样本过滤

One author examined titles and abstracts identified during the search. If the information provided by the title and abstract suggested that the study met the selection criteria, the full text was examined. Doubts about inclusions were discussed with a second author until a consensus was reached.

## 数据提取

The authors of this review evaluated all included studies. General information about the title of the study, authors, journal, and publication details were extracted. They also gathered data concerning characteristics of the participants’ age and sex (when these data were reported), soccer fitness test performed, and information related to their reliability and/or validity (the population with which they were tested, the method to identify them, and the type of statistical analysis and its coefficients). Discrepancies were resolved by a second author. The bibliography in all selected studies was analysed in search of new evidence.
