## 研究设计与流程

A systematic review was performed to analyse or inform about the reliability and/or validity of field-based tests designed to assess physical fitness in soccer referees.

## 样本收集

An evidence-based search for peer-reviewed studies was performed in the PubMed database without time limits throughout the period that goes from February 2020 to May 2020. The following search strategy and keywords were used: [“Football” OR “Soccer”] AND [“Reliability”] AND [“Validity”] AND [“Test” OR “Fitness test”]. To be selected for further analysis, the studies had to meet the following selection criteria: (i) to inform about the reliability and/or validity of at least one field-based physical fitness test when performed by referees and (ii) to be published in a scientific indexed peer-reviewed scientific journal. Among the exclusion criteria were the following ones: (i) limiting access to either the abstract or the full text of paper, (ii) studies investigating other football codes (American football, Australian football, indoor soccer) rather than soccer, (iii) using a language different from Spanish, Portuguese or English.

## 样本过滤

One author examined titles and abstracts identified during the search. If the information provided by the title and abstract suggested that the study met the selection criteria, the full text was examined. Doubts about inclusions were discussed with a second author until a consensus was reached.

## 数据提取

The authors of this review evaluated all included studies. General information about the title of the study, authors, journal, and publication details were extracted. They also gathered data concerning characteristics of the participants’ age and sex (when these data were reported), soccer fitness test performed, and information related to their reliability and/or validity (the population with which they were tested, the method to identify them, and the type of statistical analysis and its coefficients). Discrepancies were resolved by a second author. The bibliography in all selected studies was analysed in search of new evidence.
