Sample sizes ranged from 11 to 2459 FRs and ARs. Participants were elite officials in nine studies, amateur or sub-elite officials in four studies, and both elite and sub-elite in seven studies. None of the selected studies included female referees. A total of 13 studies (Table 1) analysed the psychometric properties of the physical fitness field-based tests proposed by FIFA (aerobic endurance, n = 8; anaerobic endurance, n = 3; and speed, n = 8), while seven investigations (Table 2) focused on physical fitness field-based tests specifically designed for assessing aerobic endurance (n = 1) or change of direction (COD) (n = 6).

**Table 1.** Included studies assessing FIFA field-based tests for referees.
