## Cardiorespiratory fitness tests
One study (Castagna et al., 2012) examined the Assistant Referee Intermittent Endurance test (ARIET) in terms of relative reliability, with a high intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.98; absolute reliability (4.3%CV); criterion validity (0.78, ARIET vs VO<sub>2max</sub>); convergent validity (0.95, ARIET vs YYIE1); and construct validity, showing that the ARIET was able to discriminate between assistant referees of different competitive levels (p < 0.05).

## Change of Direction tests
Six studies analysed the psychometric properties of five different COD tests, including the Modified Agility T-test Free (MATF), the Change of Direction Ability (CODA) test, the Modified Agility test (MAT), the 10-8-8-10 test and the New Football Referees test (New FR test). Two studies analysed reliability (Castagna et al., 2011; Yanci et al., 2016). They reported a relative reliability (ICC) of 0.89 and 0.90 for MAT and 10-8-8-10 test, respectively, whereas the absolute reliability, which was assessed by means of TEM, showed a 4.23%CV for MAT and 0.21%CV for 10-8-8-10 test.

On the other hand, all the studies (Castagna et al., 2011; Castillo, Cámara, et al., 2016; Castillo et al., 2019; Harley et al., 2001; Riiser et al., 2018; Yanci et al., 2016) informed about the tests’ validity. Convergent validity ranged from 0.61 (MAT) to 0.82 (New FR test). Regarding the construct validity, the MAT and the 10-8-8-10 test were valid to discriminate between referees’ levels, while the MATF test showed a significant association with referees’ age. Likewise, the MATF showed to be able to detect changes in test performance by age, with the younger referees achieving lower execution times than their older counterparts (p < 0.05).
